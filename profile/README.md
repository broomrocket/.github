# Broomrocket

Broom goes vroom! ðŸ§¹ðŸš€ Broomrocket is a suite of ?-to-3D tools aimed at everyone who is creating 3D art, from writers to artists to developers.

### The Mission

Our goal is to provide ?-to-3D tooling in a way that respects artists of all genres, adheres to licensing, and runs fully locally as well as providing the option to host a service and/or connecting to asset stores of your choice.

### The Vision

*Broom goes vroom!*

When we create worlds, we would like to focus on the feeling of experiencing our creation. For us, that means less of the *"what was that command again?"* and more of the *"let me just describe my world to you, puny computer!"* in whatever means are easiest for us - from words to drawings to programming-style schema files.

### Broomrocket for Blender

[Broomrocket for Blender](https://github.com/SomethingPinkGmbH/broomrocket-for-blender) is a Blender add-on that lets you run individual or multiple sentences and uses one of these three mesh providers: a default cube, a local folder, or Sketchfab. If you prefer to use Sketchfab, you will need an ongoing internet connection and a Sketchfab API token which you can paste into the add-on UI.

âš  Broomrocket for Blender uses prepositions in your sentences to figure out where to place your described mesh. If you use a local folder, you will have to name your files the way you talk about them in your sentences. This will likely change in the near future as we introduce metadata.

### Broomrocket Server

âš  The [Broomrocket Server](https://github.com/SomethingPinkGmbH/broomrocket-server) is currently a fully experimental socket-based server and will likely be rewritten as we continue to develop more functionality. This first experiment is written specifically to work for the Broomrocket for Godot plugin.

### Broomrocket for Godot

âš  [Broomrocket for Godot](https://github.com/SomethingPinkGmbH/broomrocket-for-godot) is also still fully experimental and serves as a testbed for us to see how we can start porting the initial Broomrocket algorithm to game engines and possibly other 3D tooling.

### Current Status

âš  None of the projects listed here are usable for any sort of production yet, other than playing around with the initial algorithms and ideas.

Right now, **we do not provide any releases or hosted service yet**, but you can check out the source code and installation instructions in the respective repositories. The Broomrocket suite is currently being developed and if you have any questions, we are happy to hear from you.
